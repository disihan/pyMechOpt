# pyMechOpt: A Python toolbox for Mechanism Optimization

pyMechOpt can optimize the chemical reaction mechanism and reduce the difference with the detailed reaction mechanism.

## Installation

It is recommended to install pyMechOpt in a newly created python environment.

| Package                                             | version  |
| --------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| [Cantera](https://cantera.org/)                     | \>=3.00  |
| [Pymoo](https://pymoo.org/)                         | \>=0.6.0 |
| [pyDecision](https://github.com/Valdecy/pyDecision) | \>=4.5.8 |

After installing the above package, you can follow the following command to install pyMechOpt:

    git clone https://github.com/disihan/pyMechOpt.git
    pip install ./pyMechOpt

## Usage

You can import modules by using the following code:

    import numpy as np
    import cantera as ct

    from pyMechOpt.multi_obj import mo_problem      # For multi-objective
    # from pyMechOpt.single_obj import so_problem   # For single-objective
    # from pyMechOpt.line_search import ls_problem  # For line search method

Firstly, provide the mechanism that needs to be optimized and an accurate mechanism:

    mech_detailed = 'mech/gri30.yaml'               # detailed mech
    mech_reduced = 'mech/gri30-r45.yaml'            # reduced mech

Given the species to be optimized and the initial conditions:

    spcs_int = ['CH4',
                'O2']
    spcs_peak = ['CH2O',
                'CO',
                'CO2']

    pressure = 1e05 * np.array([1, 1, 1, 100, 100, 100])
    temperature = np.array([1000, 1000, 1000, 1000, 1000, 1000])
    ratio = np.array([0.25, 1, 4, 0.25, 1, 4])

Then you can start optimizing.

    opt_prob = mo_problem(
        mech_detailed,
        mech_reduced,
        temperature,
        ratio,
        pressure,
        spcs_int,
        spcs_peak,
        range_input=0.1,
        weight=[1, 1, 1, 1],
        hist_dir="./hist_nsga3/",
        res_dir="./res_nsga3/",
    )
    opt_prob.calc_skip()
    opt_prob.run(algorithm="NSGA3", max_gen=400, pop_size=200)
